This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming.

Determine based on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width flower species name.

Use this data to determine.

1. Segregate features and classes.

2. Split the data into train and test

3. Train the Random ForestClassifier and LogisticRegression 

4. Compare the accuracy of each model.

5. Show by running inference for features to determine a flower species.

It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning . 
Here some of algorithm are used.
